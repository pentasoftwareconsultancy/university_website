          We envision a new world of learning, one where students become lifelong learners and
          develop 21st-century skills. It's a world where innovation is the rule, not the exception.
          It's a world where schools provide rigorous project-based learning, social and emotional learning,
          and access to new technology. It's a world where students and parents, teachers and administrators,
          policymakers, and the people they serve are all empowered with a shared vision to change education for the better.
